        <p>The firmware file has been uploaded successfully and the device is about to upgrade. Please allow <b>5
            mins</b> for the device to finish upgrading. The device will reboot twice before it is ready to use
            again. If the upgrade is successful, data in the <code>/home</code> directory should remain unchanged.

        <p><b>Important note:</b>

        <p>The current version number of the device is <i>params_version</i>. After the upgrade, please log in via the
        serial port and run the command <code>configure_edison --version</code> to verify that the version number has
        changed. If that is not the case, the upgrade has failed and you must run the <code>reboot</code> command to
        restore the device to its previous state.
